# MAMaLGam - Bias Variance Trade Off
### Improvement of the MAMaLGam algorithm for the multi-objective Bias-Variance Tradeoff task.
To improve the performance of MAMaLGam with respect to the bias-variance trade off problem, two methods based on the addition of noise are proposed. Adding noise that leads to an improvement on an objective function generates a mutation on individuals within the clusters.

### Uncrowded-hypervolume based multi-objective optimization
This repository contains implementations (C++) of different uncrowded-hypervolume based methods for (gradient-free) multi-objective optimization. Using the (uncrowded) hypervolume, multi-objective optimization problems can be formulated as (high-dimensional) single-objective optimization problems, in the hypervolume of a solution sets is optimized. For details, see the corresponding publications/preprints.
